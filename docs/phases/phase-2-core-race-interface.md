# Phase 2: Core Race Tracking Interface

## Objective
Create a mobile-first responsive interface with dual independent counters (At Gate/In Staging) that allows race officials to track moto progression with proper validation and visual feedback.

## Detailed Requirements
- Mobile-first responsive design with TailwindCSS
- Dual independent counters with 72px font size
- Touch-optimized UI with 44px+ touch targets  
- Real-time updates without page refresh
- Visual distinction: red border for At Gate, orange for In Staging
- Counter controls: increment (+1), decrement (-1), direct input with GO button
- Input validation with error alerts
- No zoom viewport locking

## Detailed Task List

### Controller & Views Setup
- [x] Generate RacesController with show and admin actions

- [x] Add before_action to find club by slug
- [x] Handle missing clubs with proper error pages
- [x] Set up proper instance variables for views

### Mobile-First Layout Design
- [x] Create application layout with viewport meta tag (no zoom)
- [x] Design container with 10px padding
- [x] Implement vertical stacking for mobile-first approach
- [x] Add 15px margins between sections
- [x] Set up responsive typography with Roboto font family

### Counter Control Buttons
- [x] Implement increment buttons for each counter:
  - Large size with green background (#28a745)
  - 18px button text
  - 44px minimum touch target
  - Touch feedback animations (needs Stimulus)
- [x] Implement decrement buttons for each counter:
  - Smaller size (50% of increment) with gray background (#6c757d)  
  - 16px button text
  - 44px minimum touch target
  - Touch feedback animations (needs Stimulus)
- [x] Add 8px border radius for all buttons

### Direct Input & GO Button
- [x] Create number input fields for each counter:

### Error Handling & User Feedback
- [x] Create flash message display system
- [x] Implement validation error display
- [x] Add loading spinners for async operations
- [x] Create user-friendly error messages
- [x] Handle network connectivity issues

### Alberta BMX Testing Data
- [x] Create seed data with realistic Alberta BMX clubs:
  - Calgary BMX Association
  - Edmonton BMX Association  
  - Red Deer BMX Association
  - Lethbridge BMX Track
- [x] Set up sample races with authentic moto progressions
- [x] Test with realistic race day scenarios

## Testing Instructions
1. Visit club-specific URL: `http://localhost:3000/calgary-olympic-bmx`
2. Test counter increments and decrements
3. Verify validation rules prevent invalid sequences
4. Test direct input with GO buttons
5. Confirm mobile responsiveness on various screen sizes
6. Validate touch targets are 44px+ on mobile devices

## Completion Criteria
- [x] Mobile-first responsive interface implemented
- [x] Dual counters with proper styling and 72px font
- [x] Touch-optimized controls with 44px+ targets
- [x] Real-time updates working without page refresh
- [x] All validation rules implemented and functional
- [x] Error handling and user feedback complete
- [x] Alberta BMX test data and scenarios working
- [x] **Ready for review**

## Branch Management
- [x] Create feature branch: `phase-2-core-race-interface`
- [x] Commit changes in logical groups:
  - "Add RacesController with club routing and error handling"
  - "Create mobile-first layout with viewport configuration"
  - "Implement dual counter display with color-coded styling"
