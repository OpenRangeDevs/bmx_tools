# Phase 6.2: Platform Admin Dashboard

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE
**Branch**: `phase-6-2-admin-dashboard`
**Dependencies**: Phase 6.1 complete (Authentication Foundation)

## Overview
Create the platform administration dashboard that provides Super Admins with a comprehensive view of all clubs, platform metrics, and quick access to management functions. This phase focuses on the read-only dashboard views and navigation structure.

## Technical Design

### Controller Structure
```ruby
# Admin namespace for all platform admin controllers
Admin::BaseController < ApplicationController
  - Authentication and authorization checks
  - Shared admin layout

Admin::DashboardController < Admin::BaseController
  - Platform metrics and overview
  - Activity monitoring
  - Quick action buttons
```

### Key Metrics to Display
- Total number of clubs (active/inactive)
- Total races run across platform
- Currently active races
- Recent activity across all clubs
- Platform usage trends

## Detailed Task Checklist

### 1. Create Admin Namespace Structure
- [x] Generate Admin::BaseController
- [x] Add authentication checks: `before_action :require_super_admin!`
- [x] Set admin layout if needed
- [x] Add common helper methods for admin views

### 2. Build Dashboard Controller
- [x] Generate Admin::DashboardController
- [x] Create `index` action with platform metrics:
  ```ruby
  @total_clubs = Club.count
  @active_clubs = Club.joins(:race).where(...)
  @total_races = Race.count
  @active_races = Race.where(...)
  @recent_activity = ... # Last 10 actions
  ```
- [x] Add caching for expensive queries
- [x] Implement activity tracking queries

### 3. Create Dashboard Views
- [x] Create `app/views/admin/dashboard/index.html.erb`
- [x] Design metric cards layout:
  - [x] Total Clubs card
  - [x] Active Races card
  - [x] Today's Activity card
  - [x] Platform Health card
- [x] Add quick action buttons:
  - [x] "Add New Club" button
  - [x] "View All Clubs" link
  - [x] "Platform Settings" (future)
- [x] Implement responsive grid layout

### 4. Implement Activity Feed
- [x] Create activity tracking without full audit log (simplified for now)
- [x] Display recent actions:
  - [x] Club creations
  - [x] Race resets
  - [x] Admin logins
- [x] Format activity items with timestamps
- [x] Add real-time updates with Turbo Streams (optional)

### 5. Style with TailwindCSS
- [x] Match existing application design language
- [x] Create admin-specific color scheme if needed
- [x] Ensure mobile responsiveness
- [x] Add loading states for metrics
- [x] Implement smooth transitions

### 6. Add Navigation
- [x] Create admin navigation partial
- [x] Include links to:
  - [x] Dashboard (current page)
  - [x] Clubs (Phase 6.3)
  - [x] Settings (future)
  - [x] Logout
- [x] Add user info display (email, role)
- [x] Implement active state styling

### 7. Update Routes
- [x] Add admin namespace routes:
  ```ruby
  namespace :admin do
    get '/', to: 'dashboard#index'
    get '/dashboard', to: 'dashboard#index'
  end
  ```
- [x] Ensure routes require authentication

### 8. Write Tests
- [x] Dashboard controller tests:
  - [x] Requires super_admin authentication
  - [x] Displays correct metrics
  - [x] Handles empty data gracefully
- [x] View tests:
  - [x] All metric cards render
  - [x] Navigation displays correctly
  - [x] Quick actions present
- [x] Integration tests:
  - [x] Full dashboard flow
  - [x] Authorization enforcement

## Acceptance Criteria
1. ✅ Super Admin can access dashboard at `/admin/dashboard`
2. ✅ Dashboard displays accurate platform metrics
3. ✅ Quick action buttons are present and styled
4. ✅ Non-super admins cannot access dashboard
5. ✅ Dashboard is mobile responsive
6. ✅ All tests passing

## Testing Instructions
```bash
# Ensure Phase 6.1 is complete
rails db:migrate
rails db:seed

# Run tests
rails test test/controllers/admin/

# Manual testing
1. Start server: rails server
2. Login as super admin: roger@openrangedevs.com / roger123!
3. Should redirect to /admin/dashboard
4. Verify all metrics display correctly
5. Check responsive design on mobile
6. Test quick action buttons (will 404 until Phase 6.3)
7. Verify logout works
```
