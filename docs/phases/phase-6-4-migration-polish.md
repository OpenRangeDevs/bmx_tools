# Phase 6.4: Migration & Polish

**Status**: NOT STARTED  
**Branch**: `phase-6-4-migration-polish`  
**Dependencies**: Phase 6.3 complete (Club Management CRUD)  

## Overview
Replace the existing session-based authentication with the new User-based system, ensure backward compatibility, polish the UI, and deploy to production. This phase completes the platform administration feature and ensures a smooth transition for existing functionality.

## Key Objectives
- Migrate existing club admin authentication to new system
- Maintain backward compatibility for all existing URLs
- Polish UI with consistent design language
- Ensure comprehensive test coverage
- Deploy to production with zero downtime

## Detailed Task Checklist

### 1. Replace Club Admin Authentication
- [ ] Update `Admin::SessionsController` for club admins:
  ```ruby
  # Now checks User model instead of hardcoded password
  def create
    user = User.find_by(email: params[:email])
    if user&.authenticate(params[:password]) && user.admin_for?(@club)
      session[:user_id] = user.id
      redirect_to club_admin_path(@club)
    else
      # handle error
    end
  end
  ```
- [ ] Update login form to use email instead of password only
- [ ] Maintain session timeout functionality (4 hours)
- [ ] Update all authorization checks

### 2. Update RacesController
- [ ] Replace old admin authentication checks
- [ ] Use new helper methods:
  ```ruby
  before_action :require_club_admin!, only: [:admin, :update, :update_settings, :create_new_race]
  
  def require_club_admin!
    redirect_to login_path unless current_user&.admin_for?(@club)
  end
  ```
- [ ] Ensure all admin actions use new auth
- [ ] Test real-time updates still work

### 3. Remove Old Authentication Code
- [ ] Remove hardcoded password checks
- [ ] Clean up old session management code
- [ ] Remove unused authentication helpers
- [ ] Update or remove old admin tests
- [ ] Clean up credentials/environment variables

### 4. Ensure Backward Compatibility
- [ ] Keep all existing URLs working:
  - [ ] `/:club_slug` - public race page
  - [ ] `/:club_slug/admin` - club admin page
- [ ] Add redirects for old login URLs:
  ```ruby
  get '/:club_slug/admin/login', to: redirect('/login')
  ```
- [ ] Ensure existing bookmarks continue working
- [ ] Test all club-specific functionality

### 5. UI Polish and Consistency
- [ ] Review all new views for consistency
- [ ] Ensure TailwindCSS classes match existing styles
- [ ] Add loading states for all async operations
- [ ] Implement smooth transitions
- [ ] Add helpful empty states
- [ ] Ensure all forms have proper error handling
- [ ] Verify mobile responsiveness

### 6. Add Turbo Streams
- [ ] Real-time updates on admin dashboard

- [ ] Form submissions without page reload
- [ ] Inline editing where appropriate

### 7. Comprehensive Testing
- [ ] Run full test suite: `rails test`

  - [ ] Super admin login → dashboard → create club
  - [ ] Club admin login → manage race
  - [ ] Public user → view race
- [ ] Test migration scenarios
- [ ] Performance testing with multiple clubs

### 8. Production Preparation
- [ ] Update production seeds:
  ```ruby
  # Create default super admin if not exists
  unless User.exists?(email: 'roger@openrangedevs.com')
    # Create super admin
  end
  ```
- [ ] Prepare deployment instructions
- [ ] Document any manual steps needed
- [ ] Create rollback plan

### 9. Documentation Updates
- [ ] Update CLAUDE.md with new auth system
- [ ] Update admin guides
- [ ] Document new Super Admin features
- [ ] Create migration guide for existing admins
- [ ] Update API documentation (if any)

### 10. Deploy to Production
- [ ] Create production backup
- [ ] Deploy with Kamal:
  ```bash
  bin/kamal deploy
  ```
- [ ] Run production migrations
- [ ] Seed production database
- [ ] Verify all functionality
- [ ] Monitor for errors
