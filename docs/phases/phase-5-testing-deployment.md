- **Data Protection**: SQLite file permissions and access control
- **Network Security**: HTTPS-only, secure headers
- **Audit Logging**: Admin action logging and monitoring

## Implementation Strategy (Alpha Focus)

### Phase 5.1: Essential Testing & Quality Assurance
1. **Expand Test Suite**: Add critical integration tests for core workflows
2. **Cross-browser Testing**: Validate on Chrome, Safari, Firefox
3. **Mobile Device Testing**: Test on iOS Safari and Android Chrome
4. **Real-time Reliability**: Ensure counter updates work consistently

### Phase 5.3: Documentation & Simple Deployment
1. **User Guide Creation**: Admin and public user guides
2. **Deployment Documentation**: Simple deployment instructions
3. **Basic Setup**: Environment configuration and database setup
4. **Launch Preparation**: Final testing and demo preparation

**Phase 5.2 (Security & Performance) - SKIPPED for Alpha**
*Comprehensive security hardening and performance optimization will be addressed in post-alpha iterations based on market feedback and user adoption.*

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### High Priority Risks
1. **Real-time Reliability**: WebSocket connection stability under load
   - *Mitigation*: Connection retry logic and fallback mechanisms
2. **Mobile Performance**: Battery drain from real-time updates
   - *Mitigation*: Optimized update frequency and background sync
3. **Database Scaling**: SQLite limitations with concurrent users
   - *Mitigation*: Connection pooling and query optimization

### Medium Priority Risks
1. **Cross-browser Issues**: Feature compatibility differences
   - *Mitigation*: Comprehensive testing and polyfills
2. **Security Vulnerabilities**: Session hijacking or CSRF attacks
   - *Mitigation*: Security headers and regular audits

## Dependencies & Prerequisites
- Phase 4.2 completion (Mobile Performance & UX Enhancement)
- All 41 existing tests passing
- Production server environment access
- SSL certificate procurement
- Domain configuration access

---

**Phase Completion Criteria**: Application passes all tests, meets performance benchmarks, security audit complete, and is production-ready with comprehensive documentation.
