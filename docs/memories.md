# Project Memories

## Development Procedures & Preferences

### Review Process
- Each phase must be completed and marked as "Ready for review"
- Wait for explicit confirmation before proceeding to next phase
- Verify by testing before allowing continuation

### Git Management Per Phase
- **MANDATORY Pre-commit Process**:
  1. ALWAYS run `bundle exec rubocop` first to check code style
  2. Fix any rubocop violations before committing
  3. Make atomic, logical commits (not bulk commits)
  4. Use conventional commit format: `type(scope): description`
- **Commit Framework**:
  - Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
  - Scope: area of change (models, controllers, views, etc.)
  - Examples:
    - `feat(admin): add club management dashboard`
    - `test(clubs): add comprehensive CRUD tests`
    - `docs: complete Phase 6.4 documentation`
    - `fix(auth): resolve Settings button navigation`
- **Smart commits**: Group related changes in logical commits
- **Communication**: Provide clear instructions on how to test phase completion

### File Organization
- Master task list at `docs/master_task_list.md`
- Phase details at `docs/phases/phase-[n]-[title].md`
- Update detailed task lists in real-time within each phase file
- Do not pre-populate future phase details

### Communication
- Update memories.md with any new procedures I specify
- Confirm milestones with me regularly
- Verify changes to requirements or approach
- **Context7 Usage**: Always use Context7 MCP server to retrieve up-to-date documentation when starting a session on this project
