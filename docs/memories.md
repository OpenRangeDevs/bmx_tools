# Project Memories

## Development Procedures & Preferences

### Review Process
- Each phase must be completed and marked as "Ready for review"
- Wait for explicit confirmation before proceeding to next phase
- Verify by testing before allowing continuation

### Git Management Per Phase
- **Create new branch** when phase is complete: `phase-[n]-[feature-description]`
- **Smart commits**: Group related changes in logical commits (not all at once)
  - Example: `config/database.yml: Add default scopes to race status model`
  - Example: `app/models: Add validations for staging counter rule`
- **Communication**: Provide clear instructions on how to test phase completion

### File Organization
- Master task list at `docs/master_task_list.md`
- Phase details at `docs/phases/phase-[n]-[title].md`
- Update detailed task lists in real-time within each phase file
- Do not pre-populate future phase details

### Communication
- Update memories.md with any new procedures I specify
- Confirm milestones with me regularly
- Verify changes to requirements or approach
